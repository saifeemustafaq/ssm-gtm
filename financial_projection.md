*Note: We are currently planning to serve the US market*

### 2. SAM (Serviceable Available Market)

Students and families actively looking for online tools for college admissions and financial aid help ‚Äî who are also comfortable using digital platforms.

- Includes ~2.4M students entering college each year
- Targeting those who research and apply online, especially cost-sensitive or first-gen students
- Assume ~50% of them are tech-enabled and actively seek help

**SAM Estimate:**
- ~1.2M students/year √ó $300 average spend = ~$360M annually

### 3. SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)

The subset of SAM we can realistically reach in 3‚Äì5 years through direct marketing, partnerships, and product-market fit.

- If we capture just 1‚Äì2% of SAM in 5 years with premium subscriptions + institutional partnerships:
  - 100,000 users √ó $300/year = $30M revenue opportunity

**SOM Estimate:** ~$30M‚Äì60M within 5 years
(Assumes reaching 100K‚Äì200K users via schools, nonprofits, ambassadors, and digital marketing)
