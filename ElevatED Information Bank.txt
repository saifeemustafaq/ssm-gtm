* Our Solution: ElevatED is an AI platform simplifying college planning, scholarship tracking, and financial aid estimation with proactive, personalized recommendations.
* Why Now: Increasing college costs, fragmented information, and overburdened counselors create a critical need for accessible, intelligent guidance.

   * AI Recommendation Engine: ML models analyze academic profiles, financial situations, and career goals for tailored college & scholarship matching.
   * NLP Chatbot: Automated guidance and support.
   * Cloud Infrastructure: Secure, scalable, seamless data access.

Slide 2: Market Positioning
* Headline: Targeting the Large & Underserved College Advisory Market
* Target Market:
   * Primary (B2C): 3.93M US high school graduates annually (2.43M college-bound) & their parents seeking guidance, especially cost-sensitive/first-gen families.
   * Secondary (B2B): Educational institutions (high schools, nonprofits, universities), counselors aiming to improve student outcomes.
* * Market Size (US):
   * TAM: ~$720M/year (Estimated $300 avg spend/user for college planning tools/advice across ~2.4M seeking help). [Note: Source doc uses $188B Higher Ed Market - too broad. $720M from financial doc is more relevant TAM for advisory spend]
   * SAM: ~$360M/year (Focusing on ~1.2M tech-enabled students actively seeking online tools).
   * SOM (5-Year Goal): $30M - $60M (Capturing 100k-200k users via direct & B2B channels).
* * Positioning: ElevatED positions itself as the integrated, AI-driven, end-to-end solution bridging the gap between college applications and financial aid optimization, distinct from niche scholarship finders or basic application tools.
* (Speaker Note: Emphasize the significant market size and the specific segment ElevatED targets – those needing integrated, affordable, online help. Highlight the dual B2C/B2B approach.)

Slide 3: Problem Description (The Pain)
* Headline: Navigating College Admissions: A Maze of Complexity, Cost & Missed Opportunities

   * Time Sink: Extensive research leads to stress and often suboptimal decisions.
   * Guidance Gap: School counselors lack capacity for personalized support at scale (avg. 408:1 student-to-counselor ratio nationally).
   * Inequity: Students from underprivileged backgrounds face greater financial and informational barriers.
* * (Speaker Note: Drive home the emotional and practical pain points. Use the 55% statistic. Emphasize the time, stress, and financial consequences of the current system's failures.)

1.1 Customer & Market Intelligence
Customer Segmentation
High school students (ages 15–18) and their parents often face barriers related to financial literacy and access to trusted guidance during the college application process. According to the National College Attainment Network (2022), 55% of adults who never enrolled in college cite cost as the primary reason. A digital platform that offers personalized, AI-driven support can reduce research time and increase decision-making confidence for these families.


Key Insights
Students and families continue to leave billions in unclaimed financial aid due to the complexity of completing forms such as the FAFSA, highlighting the need for clearer tools and timely support (NCAN, 2022). Gen Z students prefer engaging with digital, mobile-first platforms and tend to trust automated, personalized tools over traditional advising formats (Schleicher, 2023). 


Market and Competitive Intelligence
The U.S. higher education market was valued at approximately $188 billion in 2023 (Grand View Research, 2023). College planning services represent approximately $2 billion in annual expenditures by families. ElevatED proposes to capture $200 million in the next five years through a combination of individual subscriptions and institutional partnerships.
